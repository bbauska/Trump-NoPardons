<h2>Todd and Julie Chrisley</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Convicted in 2022 on a host of financial and fraud-related charges, the eponymous stars of USA Network's 
"Chrisley Knows Best" hid their crimes behind their "self-presentation as self-made businesspeople," 
said The New York Times. The Chrisleys "don't look like terrorists to me," Trump reportedly told the 
pair's daughter, Savannah, while announcing the Spring 2025 pardons, Savannah said to NewsNation. "I 
don't know them, but give them my regards and wish them good luck," Trump added.

The pair have been "unfairly targeted and overly prosecuted by an unjust justice system," said White 
House spokesperson Harrison Fields in a statement to NBC News upon the pardon announcement. The family 
is now slated to appear in a new reality show, greenlit just days before the Chrisleys were officially 
pardoned on May 28, in which they will be "exposing the raw truth of their lives — past and present," 
per an official synopsis provided to People.

<h2>George Santos</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
During his brief stint in congress, former Republican Rep. George Santos made a name for himself as one 
of the most transparently fraudulent lawmakers in recent memory, while also luxuriating in intense 
public spotlight. Nevertheless, Trump’s October 2025 decision to commute Santos’ seven-year prison 
sentence for wire fraud was the “latest in his flagrant misuse of the pardon power,” USA Today said. 
The commutation is further proof that Trump sees the justice system “through a pretty clear lens” as 
being “weaponized against people who Democrats politically disagree with,” The New York Times reporter 
Michael Gold said to National Public Radio.

<h2>Jay Johnston</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
From his televised beginnings on cult favorite "Mr. Show" to his starring role on "Bob's Burgers," 
actor and comedian Jay Johnston was a mainstay on television screens for years until he was arrested 
and convicted for joining the mob of MAGA supporters who breached the U.S. Capitol building on Jan. 
6, 2021. Johnston was ultimately sentenced to more than a year in prison in part for having "cracked 
jokes and interacted with other rioters as he used a cellphone to record the violence around him," 
said NPR.

Johnston was ultimately pardoned in one of Trump's first presidential acts of his second term, along 
with hundreds of other Jan. 6 participants. Trump politicized the arrests and imprisonments of many 
Capitol rioters during the run-up to the 2024 election.

<h2>Rudy Giuliani</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
While perhaps not a “celebrity” in the traditional sense, former New York City Mayor-turned-Trump-
attack-dog Rudy Giuliani was already among the president’s highest profile associates even before 
the president pardoned his onetime attorney for Giuliani’s role in Trump’s efforts to overturn the 
2020 election results. 

The pardon, which came alongside similar acts of clemency for Trump’s other 
2020 electoral associates in November 2025, is “primarily symbolic” since “none of those named” in 
the latest batch of pardons are “currently facing federal charges,” The New York Times said. The 
federal pardons, then, are “part of a long-shot gambit” to “influence the state-level charges” 
faced by Giuliani and others by serving as a “persuasive authority for the argument that the cases 
should be tossed out,” said The Independent

<h2>NBA YoungBoy</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Born Kentrell Gaulden, rapper NBA YoungBoy ended "more than five years of legal morass" by pleading 
guilty to gun-related charges in multiple states in December of last year, The New York Times said, 
only to be made a free man as part of the president's May 28 pardon spree in late May. Gaulden's 
legal saga has "come to a conclusion," said attorney Drew Findling, who previously served as Trump's 
personal legal counsel during the since-closed Georgia election interference case. The rapper can now 
"concentrate on first and foremost his family, and then, of course, his amazing career," Findling 
said to the Times.

"I want to thank President Trump for granting me a pardon and giving me the opportunity to keep 
building — as a man, as a father and as an artist," the rapper said in a statement posted to social 
media after his release. Trump's pardon means the artist "won't have to follow the terms of his 
probation, including drug testing," said The Associated Press. YoungBoy's post-pardon tour has 
avoided "references to Donald Trump," Rolling Stone said, "even though his latest album, MASA, 
short for 'Make America Slime Again,' is a reference to Trump as a political figure."
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2>Lil Wayne</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
The president's January 2021 pardon of rap superstar Lil Wayne, born Dwayne Michael Carter Jr., came 
after speculation that the rapper was "angling for a pardon" after he "unexpectedly shared a photo" 
of himself and Trump during the 2020 campaign, Rolling Stone said. Carter, who pleaded guilty to 
felony gun possession in 2020 and faced up to a decade in prison, had exhibited his "generosity" 
through a "commitment to a variety of charities, including donations to research hospitals and a 
host of food banks," the White House said when it announced his pardon.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2>Rod Blagojevich</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
After initially commuting a raft of sentences (including wire fraud, solicitation of bribes and lying 
to the FBI) against disgraced former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich in 2020, Trump waited until Feb. 
10, 2025, to fully pardon the Democratic lawmaker. The self-proclaimed "Trumpocrat" hailed the president 
as a "great effing guy" in response.

Following his initial commutation, Blagojevich had become a "fierce defender of Trump as the president 
has faced his own legal battles," Politico said. The pair's relationship stretches back to Blagojevich's 
time as a cast member of Trump's popular NBC reality competition "The Apprentice," from which he was 
fired in the 4th week.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2>Michael 'Harry-O' Harris</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
While perhaps not a household name, Michael "Harry-O" Harris has been an instrumental figure in the 
music industry and hip-hop community, co-founding Death Row Records while behind bars for drug charges 
and attempted murder. During his incarceration, Harris not only helped launch the iconic rap label but 
also "negotiated deals with a variety of mainstream music labels," said the Los Angeles Times. Like 
Blagojevich, Harris had initially had his sentence commuted by Trump at the end of the president's 
first term, before being pardoned entirely as part of Trump's May clemency acts.

"This freedom is a gift," Harris said in a statement posted to Instagram thanking Trump and daughter 
Ivanka, as well as "Pardon-czar" Alice Marie Johnson, who has advised Trump on his clemency efforts 
following her own sentence commutation and eventual pardoning for drug-related offenses. "I will not 
waste it."
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2>Kodak Black</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Sentenced to nearly four years behind bars on federal weapons charges, rapper Kodak Black, born Bill 
Kapri, was initially granted clemency at the end of Trump's first term alongside fellow hip-hop star 
Lil Wayne. Black is a "prominent artist and community leader" who "committed to supporting a variety 
of charitable efforts, such as providing educational resources to students and families of fallen 
law enforcement officers and the underprivileged," the White House said while announcing his commuted 
sentence.

The "campaign" for Kapri's freedom was backed by a host of religious figures, "including Ohio pastor 
and former Trump advisor Darrell Scott," as well as former New York City Police Commissioner Bernie 
Kerik, who was "himself pardoned by Trump" one year prior, said the BBC. Since his pardon, Black has 
become "very loyal to Trump," XXL Magazine said. Asked in the run up to the 2024 election whether 
he'd vote for Trump, Black said, "we should have Donald Trump for like 20 years like how Russian and 
all that sh*t be doin." That summer, he also released a pro-Trump song, "ONBOA47RD," and attended 
the president's inauguration ball in January.
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
<h2>Ross Ulbricht</h2>
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Trump granted a full and unconditional pardon to Ross Ulbricht, the founder of the Silk Road dark 
web marketplace, on January 21. Ulbricht was serving a life sentence on multiple charges, including 
conspiracy to distribute narcotics and money laundering. 

“The scum that worked to convict him were some of the same lunatics who were involved in the modern 
day weaponization of government against me,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. 
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Andrew Zabavsky and Terence Dale Sutton Jr. 
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
On January 22, Trump issued a "full and unconditional pardon" to Washington, D.C., Metropolitan 
Police Department officers Andrew Zabavsky and Terence Sutton for their roles in the death of 
20-year-old Karon Hylton-Brown. 

The two were convicted on charges related to the death of Hylton-Brown, whom they pursued in a 
high-speed chase for allegedly driving a moped without a helmet. 
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Anti-Abortion Activists 
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
On January 23, Trump pardoned 23 anti-abortion activists who were convicted in 2023 under the 
Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act for blockading the entrance to a Washington, 
D.C., abortion clinic and intimidating staff and patients. 

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Rod Blagojevich 
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
On February 10, Trump pardoned former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich, who was convicted of 
multiple political corruption charges that included seeking to sell an appointment to then-
President Barack Obama’s old Senate seat. Trump had commuted Blagojevich’s 14-year sentence 
during his first term, and the pardon cleared his record. 

The president said Blagojevich’s conviction and sentencing “shouldn’t have happened.” “I’ve 
watched him. He was set up by a lot of bad people, some of the same people I had to deal with,” 
Trump said at the White House as he signed the pardon.  
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Brian Kelsey 
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
On March 11, Trump pardoned former Republican Tennessee state Senator Brian Kelsey, who was two 
weeks into a 21-month prison sentence for an illegal campaign finance scheme that he pleaded 
guilty to in 2022. He later tried to rescind his guilty plea. 
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Thomas Edward Caldwell 
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Thomas Caldwell’s sentence for his convictions stemming from the January 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. 
Capitol was commuted on the first day of Trump’s second term before the president issued a full 
pardon on March 20. 
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Devon Archer 
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
On March 25, Trump granted a full pardon to Devon Archer, a former business associate of Hunter 
Biden, who had been convicted in 2022 for defrauding a Native American tribe in a $60 million 
bond scheme.  

Trump said that Archer, who had been sentenced to one year and one day in prison, had been treated 
"very unfairly." 
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Trevor Milton 
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Trump pardoned Trevor Milton, the founder of electric vehicle start-up Nikola, on March 27. Milton 
had been sentenced to four years in prison for fraud but remained free pending an appeal. 

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
BitMEX Co-founders 
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
On March 27, Trump pardoned Benjamin Delo, Arthur Hayes, Gregory Dwyer and Samuel Reed. The four, 
who founded the BitMEX cryptocurrency exchange, had pleaded guilty to violating the Bank Secrecy 
Act by failing to implement a compliant anti-money laundering program. 

Trump also pardoned the corporation that owns the cryptocurrency exchange, HDR Global Trading Limited. 
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Michele Fiore 
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
On April 23, Trump issued a pardon for former Las Vegas city councilwoman and state lawmaker Michele 
Fiore, who had been convicted of seven counts relating to wire fraud. 

Federal prosecutors said at trial that Fiore had raised more than $70,000 for the statue of a Las 
Vegas police officer who was fatally shot in 2014 in the line of duty but spent some of it on 
cosmetic surgery, rent and her daughter’s wedding. 
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Scott Jenkins 
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
On May 27, Trump pardoned Scott Jenkins, the former sheriff of Culpeper County, Virginia, who 
was convicted of accepting more than $75,000 in bribes in exchange for appointing people as 
auxiliary deputies. Jenkins was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison in 2024. 

Trump posted on Truth Social that Jenkins and his family “have been dragged through HELL by a 
Corrupt and Weaponized Biden DOJ.”  

“This Sheriff is a victim of an overzealous Biden Department of Justice, and doesn’t deserve to 
spend a single day in jail. He is a wonderful person, who was persecuted by the Radical Left 
'monsters,' and 'left for dead,’” Trump said in the post. “He will NOT be going to jail tomorrow, 
but instead will have a wonderful and productive life.” 
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Todd and Julie Chrisley 
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
On May 28, Trump pardoned reality TV stars Todd Chrisley and Julie Chrisley, who were convicted in 
2022 of several counts of fraud and tax evasion involving more than $30 million. Todd was serving 
a 12-year sentence, and Julie was serving seven years.  

Their daughter, Savannah Chrisley, a vocal Trump supporter, had lobbied for their release and 
received the news of their pardon in a phone call from the president. 

Trump said the married couple had been “given a pretty harsh treatment based on what I’m hearing.” 
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Henry and Imelda Cuellar 
<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->
Trump on Wednesday pardoned Texas Democratic Representative Henry Cuellar and his wife, Imelda 
Cuellar, who were facing a federal bribery and conspiracy case. 

Trump said in a social media post that Cuellar “bravely spoke out against Open Borders” and 
accused Biden, a Democrat, of going after the congressman and his wife “for speaking the TRUTH.” 

Federal authorities had charged the Cuellars with accepting thousands of dollars in exchange 
for advancing the interests of an Azerbaijan-controlled energy company and a bank in Mexico. 

The congressman has said he and his wife are innocent. The couple’s trial had been set to begin 
in April of next year.

The Justice Department issued a statement saying that it follows the Justice Manual in reviewing 
pardon applications and making recommendations.

One of the pardon office’s first tasks is to seek input from the people with a stake in the 
conviction: prosecutors, sentencing judges and crime victims. The office can request an FBI 
background check. The Jan. 6 pardons were announced hours after inauguration, so no input was 
solicited in the 1,500 cases.

Among the people Trump pardoned for Jan. 6 was David Daniel of Mint Hill, North Carolina. Had 
the rules been followed, the pardon office would have learned that Daniel faces charges of 
child pornography and the sexual assault of a preadolescent girl.

In serious crimes — violence or expensive white collar crime, for example — the Justice Manual 
recommends that a suitable length of time should elapse before a pardon is even considered to 
avoid denigrating the seriousness of the offense.

That stipulation didn’t apply to Stewart Rhodes, the leader of the Oath Keepers — a far-right 
anti-government militia — who was sentenced to 18 years for trying to overthrow the government. 
He served less than two years before Trump commuted his sentence to time served. Trump has also 
pardoned at least nine people before or shortly after they reported to prison, including one 
person before sentencing.

Another important policy in the Justice Manual on pardons is whether the person has accepted 
responsibility and is remorseful: “A petitioner should be genuinely desirous of forgiveness 
rather than vindication.”

Trump pardoned Enrique Tarrio, the leader of the Proud Boys and an architect of the attack on 
the Capitol, who had been sentenced to 22 years. Afterward, Tarrio and other Proud Boys sued 
the Justice Department for $100 million, claiming they were the victims of wrongful prosecution.

Another important condition for a pardon is restitution: Have the pardon seekers paid money 
to make their crime victims whole?This brings up what Kovarsky, the Texas law professor, calls 
the “open for business pardon,” in which Trump grants pardons to people who have politically 
supported him or who may owe large sums in restitution.

A jury convicted Trevor Milton, the founder of electric truck startup Nikola, on fraud charges; a 
judge sentenced him to four years in prison. He notably had made a video in which a prototype truck 
that appeared to be driving down a highway was actually a nonfunctioning truck rolling down an incline. 

In October, Milton and his wife each donated $900,000 to Trump political committees. In March, federal 
prosecutors urged the trial judge to order Milton to pay $675 million in restitution. Two weeks later, 
shortly before Milton was to report to federal prison, Trump granted him a pardon that eliminated his 
prison sentence and wiped away his restitution to the victims of his fraud.

Milton has maintained that he is innocent, that he was the victim of dishonest Biden administration 
prosecutors, and that his political contributions had nothing to do with the pardon. He said he 
donated to Trump out of opposition to Biden’s economic policy. “I just wanted some fiscal responsibility,” 
he told a Phoenix TV reporter.

In late 2024, Paul Walczak, a Florida nursing home executive, was sentenced to 18 months in prison and 
ordered to pay $4.4 million in restitution for stealing his employees’ tax payments. Just three weeks 
after Walczak’s mother attended a $1 million-a-head fundraiser for Trump at Mar-a-Lago, the president 
pardoned Walczak, wiping out the prison term and restitution.

Trump’s pardons have proved costly for taxpayers and crime victims. Besides the group pardons of 
Jan. 6 defendants and anti-abortion protestors, the president has pardoned 46 individuals. Of those, 
more than half have been freed of fines and restitution.

Oyer, the former pardon attorney, has set up a “pardon tracker” on her website that tallies the 
price of Trump’s pardons of people and companies that owed restitution and fines. As of July 23, 
the cost to taxpayers and crime victims is more than $1.3 billion.

Oyer’s tracker also shows a growing backlog of pardon applications from ordinary Americans. The 
queue was just under 5,000 when Trump entered office. The count on July 15 had more than doubled, 
to 11,664.
